## Architecture

### User Roles & Flow

1. **Admin**

   - Creates events and adds other admins/coordinators
   - Generates participant unique keys (5-digit)
   - Scans participant QR codes to create teams
   - Assigns routes to teams
   - Manages locations and hints
   - Views real-time scores and team progress

2. **Coordinator**

   - Assigned to specific locations
   - Has location-specific QR codes
   - Validates participant scans according to team routes
   - Cannot create events or manage teams

3. **Participant**
   - No registration required
   - Uses unique 5-digit key to join events
   - Follows assigned route through locations
   - Scans location QR codes to progress

### Scoring System

- Teams get higher scores for reaching route positions faster
- Position-based scoring: 1st team gets highest score for that route position
- Wrong location scans result in penalties (-1, -2, -3 progressively)
- Timestamps tracked for all scans

### Data Models

- **User**: Authentication and role management
- **Event**: Event details and configuration
- **Participant**: Unique keys and team associations
- **Team**: Members, scores, and assigned routes
- **Location**: Coordinates, hints, and QR codes
- **ScanLog**: Timestamp tracking for all QR scans

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0+)
- Chrome browser for web development
- Node.js (for backend API - separate project)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd treasure_hunt_web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure API endpoint**
   Edit `lib/config/app_config.dart`:

   ```dart
   static const String baseUrl = 'http://your-api-server.com';
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port=3000
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build for web deployment
flutter build web

# The built files will be in build/web/
# Deploy these files to your web server
```

â””â”€â”€ manifest.json    # PWA manifest
```

## API Integration

The app expects a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

### Events

- `GET /api/events` - List events
- `POST /api/events` - Create event
- `GET /api/events/:id` - Get event details
- `PUT /api/events/:id` - Update event

### Participants

- `GET /api/participants` - List participants
- `POST /api/participants` - Create participant
- `GET /api/participants/:key` - Get by unique key

### Teams & Scoring

- `GET /api/teams` - List teams
- `POST /api/teams` - Create team
- `POST /api/scans` - Log QR scan
- `GET /api/scores/:eventId` - Get event scores

## Development

### Key Components

1. **AuthProvider**: Handles authentication state
2. **AppProvider**: Manages app data and API calls
3. **PeriodicUpdateService**: Background data refresh
4. **QRCodeWidget**: QR generation and scanning
5. **DashboardScreen**: Main interface for all roles

### Customization

- **Theme**: Edit `lib/config/theme.dart`
- **API URLs**: Edit `lib/config/app_config.dart`
- **Update intervals**: Edit `lib/services/periodic_update_service.dart`

## Deployment

### Web Hosting

1. Build the project: `flutter build web`
2. Upload `build/web/` contents to your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve the `index.html` for all routes

### Recommended Platforms

- Netlify
- Vercel
- Firebase Hosting
- GitHub Pages
- Any static web hosting service

## Security Considerations

- All API calls should use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper JWT token handling
- Validate all user inputs on the backend
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
